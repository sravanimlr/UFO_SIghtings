# UFOs
This prokect focused on implementing Javascript and HTML to create a full webpage about UFO sightings. 

## Project Overview 
The purpose of the project was to create a website using Javascript and HTML components that presented data on UFO sightings based on shape, country, state, city, and date. The website was modified with filters for a search feature and customized with an appropriate background. The page also contained a summary on the premise explaining the UFO sightings and their significance. The HTML components are used to dictate the format of the webpage, the titles, and the buttons that can be clicked. Also, the filter components are also laid out using HTML.The data that was populated on the website came from a JavaScript file called data. This data had a specific format. Finally, to create the functioning website the HTML and Javascript were brought together through app.js which presented all variables, values, and filters in the code. 

## Future Development 
In the future, it will be good to consider a way to deselect filters on the webpage. If unnecessary filters can be removed by the user, it will create a better use experience. This will create an even more dynamic webpage which can be tailored to each user differently.

## Conclusion 
In conclusion, the purpose of this project was to use Javascript and HTML together to create a functioning webpage that any user can use. It contains all the data and can be filtered based on the necessary filters and parameters.
